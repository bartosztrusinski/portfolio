  <h2 class='text-2xl font-bold'>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a Front-End Developer with a strong passion for problem-solving and a keen eye for detail.
    My focus is on building blazing fast, accessible, and responsive websites that provide users
    with seamless experiences. I enjoy using cutting-edge technologies and continuously learning to
    enhance my skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    With 2 years of experience in front-end development, I have contributed to various open-source
    projects and worked with frameworks like React, Next.js, and Astro. I also enjoy working with
    back-end technologies and have experience with Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB and
    SQL.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not coding, you can find me diving deep into the wonders of astrophysics or enjoying
    beautiful iconic and high-performance cars that sound great. I believe in continuous improvement
    and am always looking for new ways to grow and contribute to the tech community.
